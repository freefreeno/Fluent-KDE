 
 Fluent-Plasma-Stack ( Just called stack because of the amount of themes this holds)
Five color schemes with six Plasma themes and GTK themes to match all of them. If you like dark themes I think you might find one of these that fit your needs. There is different shades and darkness of the same color. Set your look and feel to breeze and then just install the color schemes and the plasma themes. Setting it to breeze first just makes it easier and that way you know you have what I intended for you to have meaning it looks the way I wanted it to. I make my themes with the Breeze window decorations only. I like them better than any others. I also only use the Breeze widgets. Once you have the colors installed and the Plasma themes you will have 5 complete themes and even an extra plasma theme I added for people that like really dark themes. I have added the Konsole color schemes also. They are not just great but they will do pretty nicely with this theme. If you would like to know the best looking one in my eyes and probably the best looking dark theme I have seen in a long time is the Fluent-darker-2 used with either the Fluent Black Plasma theme or the the matching one which is also the Fluent-darker-2
